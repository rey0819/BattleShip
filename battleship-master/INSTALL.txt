Use "make build" to build our system and use "make play" in the terminal to start the game. 
Once the game starts you can choose the game mode to play and the difficulty of the AI if you wish.
After the game begins, use "place 'start_block' 'end_block'" to place a ship. 
An example of this is "place A1 A4" which places a ship from A1 to A4, of length 4. 
The ship list is printed above each turn with the ships you still must place and their lengths. 
After you place all your ships it will switch to the next player, either a human or the AI and they will place their ships.
After all ships are placed for both players, you will take turns guessing at spots on your opponent's board using "try 'block'" 
until one player sinks all the ships of their opponent, and thus wins the game. An example of this is "try A4" which will attempt
to hit an opponent's ship on block A4.
You can also use a "rules" command to print the rules of the game and a "score" command to get your score, 
which is the current number of ships you have sunk.
To quit the game, type "quit".
