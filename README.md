# BattleShip
A BattleShip game implemented in OCaml, which can be played by two human players using the same computer or as a single user against an AI. The AI currently has two difficulties: on the easy difficulty the AI always guesses at random, on the medium difficulty the AI will first guess at random and in the case of a hit it will guess again on a tile adjacent to the hit.
This project was used as a final project for a functional programming course.
